# Variant Sudoku

This is a swift app that implements various kinds of variant sudoku constraints.

This is not very good swift. If you're learning swift I highly recommend reading someone else's swift code.

## Variants

- [x] killer cages
- [x] XV
- [] thermometer
- [] zipper lines
- [] german whispers
